# iv-sensor
A sensor for voltage and current measurements used in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Output is suitable for 3V logic level (DSPs)

###**Operation**
![Sensor operation](/Plot/
+-15V Power is supplied at P4. C1 & C2 are low-pass filter caps. The main battery signal (carrying the EIS waveform) is supplied at P2 / P3, where it passes through U1 - a LEM25 current transducer.
